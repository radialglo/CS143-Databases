For P2B.html, we created a select tag with 5 options.
The select tag has a name sel which is parameter to the server when submitted.

For P2B.java, we renamed the class P2B to correspond to the file name.
We also changed the servlet title to P2B Servlet, and the getParameter to sel to correspond to the select tag.
We also added strong tags to put emphasis on the selected option.
