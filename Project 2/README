Useful Information:
1. For Part C, we chose to limit the number of records to be displayed to 100 because otherwise, it would
have printed over 29550 records.
2. We chose to use radio buttons instead of a dropdown window because it is more convenient for the users to
choose between searching for a paper or an author.
3. We don't have any html files because all of our pages are generated dynamically using the query parameter ?page=value
